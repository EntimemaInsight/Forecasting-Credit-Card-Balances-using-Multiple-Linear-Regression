# Forecasting-Credit-Card-Balances-using-Regression-Analysis-Python-Model
This project aims to analyze a dataset containing information from 29,819 credit card holders and develop a predictive model to estimate a cardholder's credit card balance based on their characteristics. The analysis provides insights into the factors influencing credit card balances and their significance for credit card companies.

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to:
1. Understand the various factors influencing a credit card holder's balance.
2. Develop a predictive model to estimate credit card balances based on individual characteristics.
3. Provide valuable insights for credit card companies to identify customers at risk of credit default and optimize customer acquisition strategies.

Methodology
The project follows these steps:

1. Data Cleaning and Transformation:

- Remove unnecessary columns and handle outliers.
- Convert categorical data into appropriate data types.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis:

- Analyze the distribution of credit card balances.
- Calculate correlations between variables.

3. Regression Analysis:

- Build an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression model.
- Identify the relationship between predictor variables and the credit card balance.
- Evaluate the statistical significance of the model.

4. Making Predictions:

- Use the regression model coefficients to predict credit card balances for new data.

Dataset Description

The dataset consists of the following variables:

1. CID: Client Identification Number
2. Limit: Credit limit
3. Age: Age in years
4. Gender: Male or Female
5. Married: Yes or No
6. Education: Education level
7. Income: Income in EUR
8. Balance: Credit card balance in EUR
9. Results

## The analysis revealed the following key findings:

1. Credit limit (Limit) is positively correlated with credit card balance (Balance), indicating that higher credit limits are associated with higher balances.
2. Income has a positive relationship with credit card balance, suggesting that individuals with higher incomes tend to have higher balances.
3. Age shows a weak positive correlation with credit card balance, indicating a slight increase in balance as individuals grow older.
4. Gender and marital status do not significantly impact credit card balances.
